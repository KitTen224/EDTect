# 🎯 Team Onboarding - Folder Structure Fixed!

## ✅ **Issue Resolved: Folder Structure Conflicts**

The folder structure has been standardized to prevent merge conflicts between branches.

## 📁 **Correct Folder Structure**

**✅ Use This:** `EDTect/front-end/` (with dash)  
**❌ Not This:** `EDTect/frontend/` (no dash)

## 🚀 **Updated Team Member Process**

### **For Existing Team Members:**
```bash
# 1. Get latest changes
git pull origin kimhengTest-cleanup

# 2. Navigate to correct folder
cd EDTect/front-end  # ⚠️ NOTE: "front-end" with dash

# 3. Configure environment (if not done already)
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your Supabase credentials

# 4. Start development
npm run dev
```

### **For New Team Members:**
```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/KitTen224/EDTect.git

# 2. Navigate to frontend directory
cd EDTect/front-end  # ⚠️ NOTE: "front-end" with dash

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your Supabase credentials

# 5. Start development (with auto-setup)
npm run dev
```

## 🔄 **What Changed**

### **Before (Problematic):**
- Different branches had different folder names
- Merge conflicts due to folder structure differences
- Confusion about which folder to use

### **After (Fixed):**
- ✅ **Standardized folder name:** `front-end/`
- ✅ **All branches will use same structure**
- ✅ **No more merge conflicts**
- ✅ **Clear team instructions**

## 💡 **Why This Folder Name**

We chose `front-end/` (with dash) because:
- ✅ Matches existing convention in other branches
- ✅ Clear separation from backend (`back-end/`)
- ✅ Follows common project naming patterns
- ✅ Prevents merge conflicts

## 🎉 **Everything Still Works**

All your progress is preserved:
- ✅ Authentication system
- ✅ Bug fixes
- ✅ Setup automation
- ✅ Documentation
- ✅ All features and improvements

## 📋 **Team Checklist**

When you next work on the project:

1. ✅ Pull latest changes: `git pull origin kimhengTest-cleanup`
2. ✅ Use correct folder: `cd EDTect/front-end` 
3. ✅ Check environment: Ensure `.env.local` is configured
4. ✅ Start development: `npm run dev`
5. ✅ Verify everything works: Create account, test features

## 🆘 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **"Can't find frontend folder"**
- ✅ **Solution:** Use `front-end` (with dash) instead

### **"npm run dev doesn't work"**
- ✅ **Solution:** Make sure you're in `EDTect/front-end/` directory

### **"Environment variables missing"**
- ✅ **Solution:** Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and add your credentials

### **"Setup script fails"**
- ✅ **Solution:** Check Supabase credentials in `.env.local`

## 🎯 **Ready for Merging**

The folder structure is now standardized and ready for:
- ✅ Merging with other branches
- ✅ Team collaboration
- ✅ Future development
- ✅ Deployment

Your team can now work together without folder conflicts! 🚀
